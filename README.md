# global-warming-scraper
This repo will house the source code for an application that scrapes the Gallup website for polling data concerning global warming as well as several (TBD) sites containing data about extreme weather events in the United States over the same time period covered by the Gallup website polls. The user will have three dropdown menus: one for year and one for poll question and one for region of the united states. The user must select one from each menu (there will be defaults). Once one has been selected a bar graph of extreme weather events in that region that year will populate alongside the reponses to the chosen polling question. The hope is to gain insight into whether people begin to believe in global warming upon experiencing extreme weather events.
